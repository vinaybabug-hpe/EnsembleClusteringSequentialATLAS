* A Node struct describes a single node in a tree created by hierarchical
* clustering. The tree can be represented by an array of n Node structs,
* where n is the number of elements minus one. The integers left and right
* in each Node struct refer to the two elements or subnodes that are joined
* in this node. The original elements are numbered 0..nelements-1, and the
* nodes -1..-(nelements-1). For each node, distance contains the distance
* between the two subnodes that were joined.
